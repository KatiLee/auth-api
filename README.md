# auth-api

## Plan of Attack! Task 1:
- create new repo
- add starter code
- make sure we got configs
- extract all files from api-server, bring to root of new auth-api
- npm i, also check that all the packages from both package.json's are installed
- put auth folder into the new src folder
- confirm it works:
    - one models/index.js -> import users from auth/models into src/models
